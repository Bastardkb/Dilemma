### BOM

| Part name               | Amount | Notes               |
| ----------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| M3x4 Heat-set inserts           | 4     |  |
| M3x6 BHCS / SHCS | 4      |          |
| 40mm cirque trackpad, flat overlay | 1      | TM040040-2024-302         |
| Pieces of 1.75mm Filament | 3      | 50-75mm is more than enough*        |

* If you do not have filament available, alignment key STL's are included

### Notes

- The STL's are pre-oriented for their preferred printing position for FDM
- None of the parts need supports
- The Cirque trackpad holder should work with MX keycaps (18mm x 18mm) but has not been verified. (Rev 1)
- The cirque holder was tested with Cirque Part Number TM040040-2024-302. Others may fit but have not been verified.
- The upper and lower cirque holders require bits of filament and adhesive to hold the two parts together. It was designed this way to prevent the use of supports and maintain dimensional accuracy
- The filament / alignment keys are intentionally a tight fit to maintain alignment.
