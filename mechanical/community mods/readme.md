Notes in no particular order:
-The Cirque trackpad holder should work with MX keycaps (18mm x 18mm) but has not been verified. (Rev 1)
-The case was designed around the DIY v0.1c PCB. Other versions may work but have not been verified.
-The cirque holder was tested with Cirque Part Number TM040040-2024-302. Others may fit but have not been verified.
-The STL's are pre-oriented for their preferred printing position for FDM.
-None of the parts need supports.
-The upper and lower cirque holders require bits of filament and adhesive to hold the two parts together. It was designed this way to prevent the use of supports and maintain dimensional accuracy.
-The filament / alignment keys are intentionally a tight fit to maintain alignment. 
-The case has .25mm of clearance all around the perimeter of the PCB
-The parts can be mirrored for whichever side you want the part for. The case and blank cover are originally modelled for the left side and the cirque holder for the right side. (Rev 1)
